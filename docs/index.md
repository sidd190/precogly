# Precogly

## The open-source alternative to commercial threat modeling platforms

!!! success "v0.2.0 Released"
    Precogly v0.2.0 is now available. See the [changelog](changelog.md) for details, or [download the release on GitHub](https://github.com/precogly/precogly/releases/tag/v0.2.0).

Open-source threat modeling tools lack enterprise features. Commercial tools come with heavy price tags and vendor lock-in. Precogly bridges this gap and democratizes threat modeling for every organization in the world.
