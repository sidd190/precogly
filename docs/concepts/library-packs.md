# Library Packs

Library packs are modular bundles of threat-modeling content that you import into your Precogly organization. They provide a structured starting point so your team doesn't have to build threat models from scratch.

## What's in a library pack?

A pack can contain any combination of:

- **Components** — technology building blocks (e.g., Amazon S3, API Gateway, PostgreSQL)
- **Threats** — what can go wrong for each component (e.g., S3 Bucket Public Exposure)
- **Countermeasures** — security controls that mitigate threats (e.g., S3 Block Public Access)
- **Taxonomy mappings** — links from threats to STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, CAPEC, CWE
- **Compliance mappings** — links from countermeasures to standards like NIST CSF, ASVS, SOC 2, PCI-DSS
- **DFD templates** — pre-built Data Flow Diagrams with components already wired up

When you add a component from a library pack to your threat model, its associated threats and countermeasures come with it — along with all taxonomy and compliance links.

## Pack types

| Type         | Contains                                                   | Example                         |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `technology` | Components only                                            | `aws`, `azure`, `gcp`           |
| `full`       | Components + threats + countermeasures + joins + templates | `aws-mini`                      |
| `compliance` | Framework definitions with requirements                    | `nist-csf`, `pci-dss`           |
| `taxonomy`   | External threat classification taxonomies                  | `stride-taxonomy`, `mini-capec` |
| `template`   | DFD templates only                                         | —                               |

## YAML structure

Every pack is a directory under `libraries/packs/`, organized by category (`taxonomies/`, `standards/`, `threat-libraries/`). Only `pack.yaml` is required — other files depend on the pack type.

```
threat-libraries/aws-mini/
├── pack.yaml                    # Pack metadata (required)
├── components.yaml              # Component definitions
├── threats.yaml                 # Threat definitions

### pack.yaml

```yaml
pack:
  schema_version: 1
  slug: aws-mini
  name: AWS Mini
  version: 1.1.0
  pack_type: full
  description: |
    A minimal AWS pack with core services,
    threats, and countermeasures.
  author: Precogly
  depends_on:
    - taxonomies/stride-taxonomy
    - taxonomies/mini-capec
    - taxonomies/mini-cwe
    - taxonomies/mini-attack
  tags:
    - aws
    - cloud
    - demo
    - mini
```

`schema_version` declares which version of the pack format this pack uses. The app checks this at import time and rejects packs with an unsupported version. This is separate from `version`, which tracks changes to the pack's content.

Here's how the YAML maps to what you see in the UI when previewing a pack:

![Pack preview — Components](../assets/images/library-packs-preview-components.png)

![Pack preview — Threats with taxonomy tags](../assets/images/library-packs-preview-threats.png)

![Pack preview — Countermeasures with control type and cost](../assets/images/library-packs-preview-countermeasures.png)

![Pack preview — Compliance framework requirements](../assets/images/library-packs-preview-compliance-mappings.png)

![Pack preview — Taxonomy entries](../assets/images/library-packs-preview-taxonomies.png)

### components.yaml

```yaml
components:
  - id: s3
    name: Amazon S3
    category: datastore # process | datastore | external_human_actor | external_system_actor
    type: Object Storage
    provider: aws
    description: |
      Amazon Simple Storage Service for scalable object storage.
```

### threats.yaml

```yaml
threats:
  - id: s3-public-exposure
    name: S3 Bucket Public Exposure
    description: |
      S3 bucket is publicly accessible, exposing sensitive data.
```

### countermeasures.yaml

```yaml
countermeasures:
  - id: s3-block-public-access
    name: S3 Block Public Access
    description: |
      Enable S3 Block Public Access at account and bucket level.
    control_type: preventive # preventive | detective | corrective | deterrent | recovery | compensating | procedural
    cost: low # low | medium | high
```

### Join files

Join files in the `joins/` directory define relationships between items.

**components-threats.yaml** — which threats apply to which components:

```yaml
mappings:
  - component: s3
    threats:
      - threat: s3-public-exposure
        applies_to: component # component | flow | both
```

**threats-countermeasures.yaml** — which countermeasures mitigate which threats:

```yaml
mappings:
  - threat: s3-public-exposure
    countermeasures:
      - s3-block-public-access
      - s3-bucket-policy
```

**threats-{taxonomy}.yaml** — maps threats to taxonomy entries:

```yaml
taxonomy: stride

mappings:
  - threat: s3-public-exposure
    entries: [information-disclosure]
```

**countermeasures-{framework}.yaml** — maps countermeasures to compliance requirements:

```yaml
framework: nist-csf-2

mappings:
  - countermeasure: s3-bucket-policy
    requirements:
      - "PR.AC-4"
    sufficiency: full # full | partial
```

## How to import a library pack

!!! note "Import requires Security Team role"
The **Import** button is only visible to users with the **Security Team** organization role. If you don't see the Import button, ask your organization admin to update your role from **Member** to **Security Team** in the organization settings.

1. Navigate to the **Library Packs** section from the sidebar
2. Browse available packs — you can filter by type, tag, or search by name
3. Click on a pack to preview its components, threats, and countermeasures
4. Click **Import** to add it to your organization

Packs with dependencies (e.g., `aws-mini` depends on `stride-taxonomy`, `mini-capec`, etc.) will show which dependencies need to be imported. Dependencies are **not enforced** — you can import a pack without its taxonomy dependencies if you don't need taxonomy enrichment (STRIDE, CAPEC, CWE tags on threats). Import taxonomy packs first if you want full taxonomy linking.

![Import dialog with dependency checks and compliance overlay selection](../assets/images/library-packs-import-dialog.png)

!!! info "Compliance overlay selection"
When importing a pack, you can choose which compliance framework mappings to include. For example, import only NIST CSF mappings without SOC 2 if that's all you need. You will get warnings if packs that are depended upon by the importing pack have not yet been imported.

## How to unimport a library pack

1. Navigate to the **Library Packs** section
2. Switch to the **Imported** tab
3. Find the pack and click **Unimport**

![Imported packs with Unimport buttons](../assets/images/library-packs-imported.png)

Unimporting removes the library definitions (components, threats, countermeasures) but **does not delete** any threat model data you've already created using that pack. Your existing threat models keep their data — they just lose the link back to the library definition.

!!! warning
You cannot unimport a pack if other imported packs depend on it. Unimport the dependent packs first.

**Taxonomy packs vs. compliance packs:** Taxonomy packs (STRIDE, CAPEC, CWE, etc.) cannot be unimported while content packs that reference them are still imported — taxonomies directly enrich threat data. Compliance packs (NIST CSF, ASVS, etc.) can be unimported independently since compliance mappings are optional and degrade gracefully.

## How to author a library pack

Creating your own pack involves writing YAML files following the structure above. For the complete authoring guide with field references, validation checklists, DFD template syntax, and cross-pack references, see:

[`libraries/README.md`](https://github.com/precogly/precogly/blob/main/libraries/README.md)

## Troubleshooting

**Imported a pack but taxonomy tags are missing on threats**
: Taxonomy packs (STRIDE, CWE, CAPEC, etc.) must be imported **before** the content pack that references them. If you imported without taxonomy dependencies, the components, threats, and countermeasures are fine — but taxonomy links (e.g., STRIDE categories on threats) won't be present. To fix this, unimport the pack, import the taxonomy packs, then re-import.

**Taxonomy mappings not showing up**
: Same as above — taxonomy packs must be imported first. The seed data imports taxonomies first for this reason.

**Compliance mappings not appearing**
: If the compliance framework pack (e.g., `nist-csf`) wasn't imported when the content pack was imported, the mappings are stored as pending. Import the framework pack and the mappings will activate automatically.

**Unimport blocked**
: Another pack depends on the one you're trying to remove. Check which packs list it in their `depends_on` and unimport those first. Note that taxonomy packs are protected this way because they enrich threat data, while compliance packs can be unimported freely since their mappings are optional.
